## üß™ Integration Test Suite

### Test User Flow (End-to-End)

#### Test 1: User Report Submission & Payment
```
1. Login as user (user@company.com / user123)
2. Upload report file (CSV or HTML)
3. Select report date
4. Click "Send for Approval"
5. Verify redirect to payment screen
6. Select any payment method
7. Upload payment proof
8. Verify success message: "Your payment has been sent to manager for review"
9. Check payment appears in Payment History with status "pending"
10. Verify notification is created
```

#### Test 2: Manager Approval Flow
```
1. Login as manager (manager@company.com / manager123)
2. Navigate to Manager Dashboard
3. Verify pending payments queue shows new payment
4. Approve the payment
5. Verify user receives notification of approval
6. Check payment status changes to "approved"
7. Verify real-time updates without refresh
```

#### Test 3: Dashboard Data Accuracy
```
1. Login as admin (admin@company.com / admin123)
2. Verify all dashboard stats show real data (no fake percentages)
3. Check that statistics update after new reports/payments
4. Verify no hardcoded values like "+12% this month"
```

### API Test Cases

#### Authentication Tests
```bash
# Test valid login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@company.com","password":"user123"}'

# Test invalid credentials
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"invalid@test.com","password":"wrong"}'
```

#### Payment Creation Tests
```bash
# Test payment creation (replace TOKEN and REPORT_ID)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/payments/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reportId": "REPORT_ID",
    "method": "offline", 
    "amount": 1000,
    "transactionId": "TEST_TXN_123",
    "notes": "Test payment"
  }'
```

#### Notification Tests
```bash
# Test notification list
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/notifications/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test unread count
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/notifications/unread-count \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## üîç Smoke Tests (Quick Health Checks)

### Quick Verification Script
```javascript
// Run in browser console after logging in
async function smokeTest() {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
  const tests = [
    '/api/user/dashboard-stats',
    '/api/notifications/unread-count',
    '/api/user/recent-reports',
    '/api/payments/history'
  ];
  
  for (const endpoint of tests) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
      });
      console.log(`${endpoint}: ${response.status} ${response.ok ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå'}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`${endpoint}: ERROR ‚ùå`, error.message);
    }
  }
}

smokeTest();
```

## üéØ Final Acceptance Test

Run this complete flow to verify production readiness:

1. **Upload Report**: User uploads report ‚Üí redirects to payment
2. **Submit Payment**: Upload proof ‚Üí see "sent to manager for review"
