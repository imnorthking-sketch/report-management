# Login Issue Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary

The login issue was caused by Row Level Security (RLS) policy conflicts in the Supabase database that were causing infinite recursion when trying to fetch user profiles during authentication. This resulted in "User profile not found or inactive" errors even when valid credentials were provided.

## Root Causes

1. **RLS Policy Conflicts**: The existing RLS policies on the [users](file:///C:/Users/Lucifer/Documents/react/report-calculator-nextjs/lib/supabase.ts#L147-L161), [reports](file:///C:/Users/Lucifer/Documents/react/report-calculator-nextjs/database-schema.sql#L27-L41), [payments](file:///C:/Users/Lucifer/Documents/react/report-calculator-nextjs/database-schema.sql#L44-L59), and [activity_logs](file:///C:/Users/Lucifer/Documents/react/report-calculator-nextjs/database-schema.sql#L61-L67) tables were causing infinite recursion
2. **Authentication Service Error Handling**: The authentication service was not properly handling RLS policy errors and providing adequate fallback mechanisms
3. **User Feedback**: Error messages were not descriptive enough to help users understand what was happening

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Service (`lib/supabase-auth.ts`)

- Improved error handling for RLS policy issues
- Added comprehensive fallback mechanisms using the admin client
- Enhanced error detection for various types of database permission errors
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios

### 2. Improved Auth Context (`context/AuthContext.tsx`)

- Added more specific error messaging for different login failure scenarios
- Extended error message duration to ensure users can read them
- Better differentiation between credential errors and system configuration errors

### 3. Enhanced Login Page (`pages/auth/login.tsx`)

- Improved error message handling with more user-friendly messages
- Better error categorization to help users understand the issue
- Extended toast duration for important error messages

## Manual Database Fix Required

Since the automated script cannot execute SQL commands directly, you need to manually apply the RLS policy fixes in your Supabase dashboard:

### Steps to Apply Manual Fix:

1. **Access Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Log in to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor

2. **Execute the Following SQL Commands**:

```sql
-- Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own payments" ON payments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all activity logs" ON activity_logs;

-- Create new policies without recursion
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON users
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = id OR
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') IN ('admin', 'manager')
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own reports" ON reports
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id OR
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') IN ('admin', 'manager')
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own payments" ON payments
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id OR
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') IN ('admin', 'manager')
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all activity logs" ON activity_logs
  FOR SELECT USING ((auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'admin');

-- Refresh the schema
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

3. **Restart Your Application Server**:
   - Stop your development server (`Ctrl+C`)
   - Restart with `npm run dev`

## Test Credentials

After applying the fix, you can test with these credentials:

- **Admin**: manish.epacific@gmail.com / password
- **Manager**: manager@epacific.com / manager123
- **User**: user@epacific.com / user123

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Try logging in with each account type
2. Check that you're redirected to the correct dashboard
3. Verify that user profiles load correctly
4. Confirm no "User profile not found or inactive" errors appear

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh your browser or clear cache
2. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env.local` file has correct Supabase credentials
3. **Verify Database Connection**: Run `node test-all-logins.mjs` to test database connectivity
4. **Check Supabase Logs**: Review authentication logs in your Supabase dashboard

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always test RLS policy changes in a development environment first
2. Use the `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` pattern when creating policies
3. Avoid recursive queries in RLS policy definitions
4. Regularly review and test authentication flows after database schema changes
