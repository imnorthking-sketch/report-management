## 🧪 **QUICK SMOKE TEST**

Run this in browser console to verify APIs:
```javascript
// Test after logging in
const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
fetch('/api/notifications/unread-count', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log('Notifications:', d));

fetch('/api/payments/history', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log('Payments:', d));
```
