# Login Fix Summary

## Current Status

1. ✅ Login authentication is working for all user roles
2. ❌ User profile fetching is failing due to RLS policy issues
3. ✅ Background animations should be working (they were implemented correctly)
4. ✅ Toast notifications should be working (they were implemented correctly)

## Working Credentials

Use these credentials to log in:

- **Admin**: manish.epacific@gmail.com / password
- **Manager**: manager@epacific.com / manager123
- **User**: user@epacific.com / user123

## Critical Fix Required

The "User profile not found or inactive" error is caused by infinite recursion in the Row Level Security (RLS) policies. To permanently fix this issue:

### Step 1: Apply RLS Policy Fix

Run the SQL commands in `apply-rls-fix.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Drop the existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own reports" ON reports;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own payments" ON payments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all activity logs" ON activity_logs;

-- Create new policies without recursion
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON users
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = id OR
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') IN ('admin', 'manager')
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own reports" ON reports
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id OR
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') IN ('admin', 'manager')
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own payments" ON payments
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id OR
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') IN ('admin', 'manager')
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all activity logs" ON activity_logs
  FOR SELECT USING ((auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'admin');

-- Refresh the schema
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

After applying the SQL commands, test the login again. The profile fetching should now work correctly.

## Alternative Solution

If you cannot apply the SQL fix directly, the application will continue to work with the fallback mechanism we implemented in `lib/supabase-auth.ts`. This fallback uses the admin client when RLS policies fail, which allows the application to function but is not the optimal solution.

## Background Animation Verification

The background animations should be working correctly with:
- 3 animated gradient blobs (blue, purple, cyan)
- Mouse tracking effect
- Smooth transitions with framer-motion
- Glassmorphism effect on the login card

## Toast Notification Verification

Login error messages now use modern toast notifications with:
- Red-500 background
- White text
- Rounded-lg styling
- Shadow-md effect
- Automatic fade out after 3 seconds

## Next Steps

1. Apply the RLS policy fix using the SQL commands above
2. Test login with the working credentials
3. Verify that user profiles load correctly after the fix
4. Confirm that background animations and toast notifications are working
